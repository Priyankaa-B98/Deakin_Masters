    "\n",
    "The MNIST digits classification dataset is a well-known dataset in the field of machine learning, particularly in image processing and pattern recognition. It is often used as a benchmark for training and testing algorithms for image classification.\n",

    "\n",
    "The dataset contains 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9. Each image is a 28x28 pixel grid, making a total of 784 pixels. Each image is associated with a label corresponding to the digit it represents, ranging from 0 to 9.\n",

    "#### The ideal number of hidden layers depends on the specific task and the nature of the data. Some tasks may require only a few layers, while others may benefit from deeper architectures. Changing the number of hidden layers in a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model can significantly impact the model's ability to learn and generalize from the data, thereby affecting its accuracy. With more hidden layers, an MLP can model more complex non-linear relationships between the input features and the output, which might not be possible with a shallower network.  When the right number of hidden layers is used, the model is more likely to generalize well to new, unseen data, improving its accuracy on the test set. As the number of layers increases, especially in very deep networks, issues like vanishing or exploding gradients can occur during training, making it harder for the model to converge to an optimal solution."

    "#### The optimal size of the hidden layers is often determined through experimentation. It involves trying different sizes and evaluating how they affect model accuracy. Changing the size of hidden layers in a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model can significantly influence the model's ability to learn from the data and thus affect its accuracy. Increasing the number of neurons (units) in a hidden layer enhances the model's capacity to learn and represent more complex functions. More neurons allow the network to capture a greater variety of patterns and features from the data.  Larger hidden layers can represent more intricate non-linear relationships between the input features and the target output. Just like with adding more hidden layers, increasing the size of hidden layers can lead to overfitting, especially if the dataset is small or noisy. Increasing the size of hidden layers in an MLP model generally enhances the model's ability to learn complex patterns and improves accuracy, especially for challenging tasks. "
